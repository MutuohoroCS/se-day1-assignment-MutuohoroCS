#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic approach to designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software.

Importance of software in the technology is:

1. Innovation through creation of new applications and technologies.
2. Reliabilty because it ensures softwrae is stable and less prone to errors.
3. Efficiency by optimizing software perfomance and resource usage.
4. Scalability because it allows software to grow and adapt to increasing demands

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Introduction of structured programming. Emphasized breaking down programs int smaller, manageable sections or modules. Improved code readability and maintainability.

2. Development of Object-Oriented programming. Introduced concepts like classea and objects to model real-world entities. Enhanced code reusability and scalability.

3. Agile Methodology. Focused on iterative development, collaboration and flexibility. Enabled faster delivery of software and better adaptation to changing requirements.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

 The key phases of the Software Development Life cycle are:

1. Planning. Define project goals,scope and feasibility, identify resources and create a project plan.

2. Requirement analysis. Gather and analyze user needs. Document functional and non-functional requirements

3. Design. Create system architecture and design specifications. Plan the user interface and data models. Plan the user interface and data models

4. Implementation. Write and compile code. Develop the software based on design documents.

5. Testing. Verify and validate the software. Identify and fix bugs to ensure quality.

6. Deployment. Release the software to users. Install and configure the system in the production environment

7. Maintenance. Provide ongoing support and updates. Address any issues or improvements needed.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

 Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach to project management. It involves distinct phases such as Requirements, Design, Implementation, testing and deployment each completed before moving on the next. This method is best suited for projects with well defined and stable requirements.An example scenario is developing a government system where requirements are clear and unlikely to change.
	The Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach. It focuses on continious cycles of planning development,testing and review often called sprints. Agile is highly flexible, allowing for changes at any stage and is ideal for projects with evolving requirements and need for rapid delivery. An example scenario would be developing a mobile app where user feedback is crucial and requirements may change frequently.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software developer writes and maintains code. They develop software features, fixes bugs and collaborates with other team members to implement solutions.

2. Quality Assurance Engineer. Ensures Software quality. Designs and executes tests, identifies defects and ensures the product meets quality standards.

3. Project manager. Oversees project progress. Plans and coordinates tasks, manages timelines and resources and communicates with stakeholders to ensure project goals are met.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

	IDEs streamline the coding process by integrating tools like code editors, debuggers and build automation into a singlr interface. this boosts Productivity,Reduces errors and enhances code quality. ana example is Visual Studio code and intellij IDEA.

	Version Control Systems manage changes to code enabling collaboration among developers. They track revisions facilitate code merging and help revert to previous versions if needed. examples include Git and Subversion(SVN)


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. rapid Advancement of Technology. They are forced to keepup with new tools,languages an frameworks. They can overcome this by continos learning through online courses, Workshops and staying active in tech communities.

2. requirement volatility. They are faced with changing project requirements. they can overcome this by using agile methodologies to adapt to changes quickly and maintain regular communication with stakeholders.

3. Time Contstraints. They are faced with tight deadlines. They can prioritize tasks, use project management tools and break work into manageable sprints.

4. Limited Resources.Insufucient infrastructure or budget. This can be overcome through optimizing resource usage, leverage cloud services and seek efficient solutions.

5. Collaboration Issues. This is Caused by poor communication with teams. This can be overcome by fostering a collaborative culture, use effective communication tools and hold regular meetings.

6. Security Threats.This can be overcome by implementing best security practices, conduct regular audits and stay updated on security trends.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

	Unit testing tests individual components or functions of the software. It ensures each part works correctly in isolation, catching bugs and making debuggging easier.

	Integration Testing tests interaction between integrated units or components. It identifies issues in the interaction between modules ensuring they work together as expected.

	System tesing tests the complete and integrated software system. Validates the systems compliance with the specified requirements ensuring the entire application functions correctly.

	Acceptance testing tests software in a real world scenario to ensure it meets business requirements. It confirms the software is ready for delivery and meets user needs providing the final verification before release.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

	Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining questions or instructions to guide AI models in generating specific desired outputs.

	impotance includes improved accuracy,enhances usability and optimize performance.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

VAGUE PROMPT:
 "Tell me about turbo charged engine"

IMPROVED PROMPT"
 "Explain how a turbo charged engine works and its advantages over naturally aspirated engine."

The improved prompt is clear specific and concise making it easier for the AI to provide a detailed and relevant response.
